# Introduction
This repository contains the unofficial code implements for the graph matching part of the paper "VIPS: real-time perception fusion for infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3495243.3560539). 

## Usage
The code provides a Python script called main.py that can be used to test the graph matching algorithm on a given set of graphs.

## Related Works
This code was used in the paper "GraphPS: Graph Pair Sequences-based Noisy-Robust Multi-Hop Collaborative Perception" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334055) to evaluate the performance of VIPS and GraphPS on various datasets, including V2X and V2V scenarios, and demonstrated the robustness of GraphPS under different levels of position and heading errors, surpassing the existing baselines.

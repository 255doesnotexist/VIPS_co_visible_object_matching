# Introduction
This repository contains the unofficial code implements for the graph matching part of the paper "VIPS: real-time perception fusion for infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3495243.3560539). 

## Usage
The code provides a Python script called main.py that can be used to test the graph matching algorithm on a given set of graphs.
